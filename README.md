# Kidney-disease-detection-
This project leverages artificial intelligence to facilitate kidney disease diagnosis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented with several optimizations that significantly enhanced the modelâ€™s accuracy. As a result, the model achieved an impressive 98.84% accuracy in classification.
